			<p>
				As professional web developers, we&rsquo;ve noticed two realities:
				<ol>
				<li>Most web sites are made up of &ldquo;boring stuff&rdquo; 
				(<abbr title="also known as">AKA</abbr> infrastructure)</li>
				<li>Web teams <strike>are opinionated bastards</strike> have their own 
					ways of doing things</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				Calloway was dreamed up to be a fast way to get a web site going. 
				It creates the infrastructure for a new web site without forcing
				you to its &ldquo;what I think is best&rdquo; practices. Our goal is to 
				allow you to specify the functionality you want included, 
				in they way you want to work so you can focus on the parts 
				that make your website unique.

			<p>
				Calloway is a &ldquo;meta&rdquo; framework. It is a small 
				<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" title="Django Project">Django</a> 
				application coupled with a Django project starter. <a href="/applications/">Third-party
				applications</a> are bundled together with dependencies to make adding
				specific functionality easy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Developer&rsquo;s (or even designer&rsquo;s) will use Calloway at the start of a project
				to get it going so they can work on the fun stuff.
			</p>
			
			<h1 class="red mt mb">What does it do?</h1>
			<p>
				<ol><li>Starts projects from a given project template</li>
					<li>Manages dependencies of applications it knows work well together</li>
					<li>Provides some good (but easily over-rideable) defaults</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to do this, there are a couple of small requirements:
				<ul><li><a href="http://pip.openplans.org/">pip</a> for managing packages</li>
					<li><a href="http://virtualenv.openplans.org/">virtualenv</a> for isolating environments and avoiding package conflicts</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/">virtualenvwrapper</a> for adding some cool hooks to virtualenv that make it easier to use</li>
				</ul>
